      <description>As I am sipping down my morning coffee and read my Twitter feed, my app is making multiple API calls over HTTPS to Twitter&amp;rsquo;s servers somewhere on the Internet. Those HTTPS connections are running over TCP via my home WiFi and broadband connection. All&amp;rsquo;s well, the WiFi connection has the least inference, the broadband connection is stable and so there&amp;rsquo;s no packet loss. Those are perfect conditions for HTTPS running over TCP.</description>

      <description>About Me Hi! I am Deepansh Sood. I was born in 1995 and spent most of my youth in Himachal Pradesh, India. I currently live in Bengaluru and write code for companies such as Wipro CRS and previously Ants Digital. Before that I studied Computer Science at Amity University.
Did I tell you the things I like? I have been fascinated by computers since my childhood and recently found myself involved with learning Rust and Haskell.</description>
